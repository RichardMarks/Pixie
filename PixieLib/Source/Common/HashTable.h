 * \brief	Stores data in a hash table, indexed by any type of key
 * \author	Mattias Gustavsson	
 * 
 * A hash table store items associated with a key, in such a way that you can quickly retrieve a value from the key.
 * Internally, the hash table stores the items in an array, and from the key it calculates a number (called a hash 
 * value), which is used to find which array entry to place the item in. This means there's no looping through the array
 * when finding an item, as the hash value is used to go straight into the right array entry.
