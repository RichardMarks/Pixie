 * \brief	Singleton class for handling platform abstraction systems
 * \author	Mattias Gustavsson
 *
 * The Platform system consists of several different systems, which defines
 * the interface to different parts of the OS or hardware. When the application
 * starts, you must define which implementation to use for each of the platform
 * systems (interfaces) that you want to utilize in your application. This is
 * done by creating an instance of the platform specific implementation, and
 * passing it to the Platform singleton, from which it can be retrieved whevenever
 * needed.
 *
 * A typical way of setting up the platform system could look like this:
 * int WINAPI WinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE hPrevInstance, LPSTR lpCmdLine, int nCmdShow)
 * 	{
 * 	Platform_Win32_OS* os=new Platform_Win32_OS(hInstance,lpCmdLine);
 * 	Platform::SetPlatform_OS(os);
 * 	Platform::SetPlatform_Time(new Platform_Win32_Time());
 * 	Platform::SetPlatform_Sound(new Platform_Win32_Sound(os));
 * 	Platform::SetPlatform_Input(new Platform_Win32_Input(os));
 * 	Platform::SetPlatform_Screen(new Platform_Win32_Screen(os));
 * 	Platform::SetPlatform_FileSystem(new Platform_Win32_FileSystem());
 *  ...
 *  }
 *
 * And any system can later be accessed by calling, for example: Platform::GetPlatform_OS()
 *
 * The platform system has been designed to be easy to port, rather than to be easy to use,
 * so it only provides a thin abstraction layer. More user-friendly functionality is built
 * on top of this in the Pixie game engine, and you rarely, if ever, need to use the Platform
 * systemes directly (thouhgh the Pixie engine makes frequent use of it).
 *
 * There's a NULL platform implementation provided, wich implements empty functions for all the
 * systems, which can be useful when porting or debugging. The NULL implementations will return
 * valid objects and have all functions callable, but they will not perform any functionality
 * and will mostly return 0 values.
