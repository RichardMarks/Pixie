 * \brief	Generic dynamic array
 * \author	Mattias Gustavsson
 * 
 * This class store items in a dynamic array, which can grow in size as needed. Every time the array is full, it is 
 * resized to twice the size. There is also an iterator available, which supports a generic iterator interface of 
 * MoveFirst, MoveNext etc. so the dynamic array can also be used like a linked list. 
 * Note though, that removing/inserting items in  the middle of the array will cause all items after that item to be 
 * moved one slot, which could potentially be a problem if you have a huge array and often need to do those operations. 
 * For most typical cases though, it's not an issue, as the memory fragmentation and cache-misses you're likely to get 
 * with linked lists typically make them much slower than using an array with reshuffling on insertion/removal.
 * Note that memory used for storing items in the array is not allocated until the first time an item is added to the
 * array - if it is important to have the memory allocated when the array is created, just do Add/RemoveLast to fix it.
