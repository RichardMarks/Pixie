 * \brief	Platform independent abstraction of the display device
 * \author	Mattias Gustavsson	
 * 
 * This is a platform abstraction of the physical screen, the display
 * device. This is what you use to display things, and it is really 
 * quite simple: you simply call Present, passing it the pixel data you
 * want to display. The idea is that you keep drawing your sprites 
 * and background to a pixel buffer you have created, and every frame you
 * call the Present method of Platform_Screen to display the results.
 *
 * Platform_Screen also includes functionality to set screen size and
 * toggle fullscreen mode. It is not guaranteed that every platform
 * makes use of this information, so consider it more of a hint than
 * an actual directive. What you DO have control over is the size of
 * your own bitmap, as that is what you will be drawing to.
 * 
 * For platform specific behavior, please refer to the header file
 * of the platform specific implementation of Platform_Screen.
