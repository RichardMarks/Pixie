 * \brief	Dynamic memory buffer
 * \author	Mattias Gustavsson
 *
 * The dynamic memory buffer is useful when you want to work with a memory buffer and not have to worry about buffer
 * overruns or allocating/freeing memory. The dynamic buffer handles all that by itself. It will dynamically grow the
 * buffer when needed, and you can safely use the Read/Write methods to manipulate its content, much like you would a
 * file, but with the speed that comes from using memory.
 *
 * It is also possible to access the memory of the buffer directly, but that can be risky as no safety checks are
 * carried out, which opens it up to possible buffer overrun problems.
 *
 * Note that memory used by the buffer is not allocated until the first time data is written to it. If it is important
 * to have the memory allocated when the buffer is created, just do Write/Clear to force the allocation.
