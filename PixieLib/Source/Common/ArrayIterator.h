 * \brief	Iterator for Array
 * \author	Mattias Gustavsson
 *
 * The iterator provides a convenient way to loop trough all the items of an Array in the same way as you would a linked
 * list. When created, the iterator points to the first item in the array, and you can then move it around using
 * MoveFirst, MoveNext, MoveLast and MovePrevious, and even search for a specific item using Find (note that such a
 * search would be looping through all items, and that can be quite slow if the array contains many items. For this type
 * of operation, consider using a HashTable instead, which provides very fast lookup of items).
