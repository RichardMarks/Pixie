 * \brief	Templated resource class to handle shared references to resources
 * \author	Mattias Gustavsson
 *
 * The resource class allows any type of object to be created through the resource manager, as long
 * as the class passed as a template parameter has a constructor which takes a const char* parameter
 * for the filename to create the resource from.
 * If the resource has not previously been created, the resource manager will create it when the
 * Resource is initialised. If it was already created, the resource manager will just return it, and
 * increase its reference count, so that a shared instance of the object will be used by all resources
 * referencing it. When all the resources referencing an object has been destroyed (and thus, the
 * reference count of the resource has reached 0), the resource manager will delete the object.
