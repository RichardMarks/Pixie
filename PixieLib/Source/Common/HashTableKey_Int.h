 * \brief	Hash table key implementation for integer keys
 * \author	Mattias Gustavsson
 *
 * Hash table key implementation for integer keys. This is the simplest
 * form of hash key, and it uses the number passed in as hash value, so
 * for some scenarios the calling code might need to transform the value
 * in some way to make it a suitable hashing value. For example, this key
 * type will work for using object pointers as hash keys, by just casting
 * the pointer to an int. However, since objects are aligned on 4 byte
 * boundaries, we waste 3 out of 4 hash entries. If the value was divided
 * by 4 before being passed to HashTableKey_Int, we wouldn't have that
 * problem. This hash key type is provided as a means to store things
 * based on any kind of hashing value. If specific behavior is wanted,
 * it is good to implement a specific hashtable key type for that type of
 * key. For example, there could be a HashTableKey_Pointer, that would
 * automatically do the divide by 4, as explained above, or do some even
 * more clever tricks, such as manipulating the bits of the value, to get
 * a more suitable hash value.
