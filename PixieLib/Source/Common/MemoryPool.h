 * \brief	MemoryPool for faster dynamic memory allocation
 * \author	Mattias Gustavsson
 *
 * Memory pools are very useful if you need to dynamically allocate and free many blocks of
 * memory that are all the same size. A memory pool works by allocating larger chunks of
 * memory, and dishing it out in smaller chunks as requested. When memory is freed, it
 * is not released, but instead recycled to be used in future requests to allocate memory.
 * Another advantage of memory pools is that blocks are kept closer to each other in memory,
 * increasing cache coherency.
