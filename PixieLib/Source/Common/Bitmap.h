 * \brief	
 * \author	Mattias Gustavsson	
 * 
 * A Bitmap is simply a collection of 16-bit color values with a width and a height.
 * It is typically used as blit target, and is also what you pass on to the Present
 * method of Platform_Screen to display stuff.
 * 
 * Bitmaps can be blitted onto other bitmaps, but this is quite slow as the code is
 * not yet optimized. It is recommended that you use just one bitmap (for your back
 * buffer) and make all your other art of the type Bitmap_RLE8, as this can be blitted
 * onto a Bitmap in the same way, but is much, much faster.
 *
 * \todo	Update Clip code to handle offset/pitch. Might be fixed, but needs cleaning up (transforms and such)
 * \todo	Additive blitting
 * \todo	Make TransformCoordinates non-inline
