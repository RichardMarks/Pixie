 * \brief	Platform independent abstraction of sound playback
 * \author	Mattias Gustavsson
 *
 * The platform system is simple but powerful - all it provides
 * is functionality to create a SoundStream object, which can
 * be used to play streaming sounds. You can create several
 * sound streams, and they can be played independently. The idea
 * is to create a few streams to use as sound channels, and then
 * keep streaming sounds to them as necessary, rather than creating
 * indidividual full sounds. The Audio module in the Pixie engine
 * implements a more user-friendly sound system built on top of
 * this, which allows for playing of music and sound in a more
 * traditional way.

		 * sound data to the sound card, and works by having the calling application fill and refill the
		 * sound-stream buffer with new sound data as needed. The returned instance should be destroyed
		 * by the caller (using the delete keyword). when it is no longer needed.
